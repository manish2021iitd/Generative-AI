Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014.

GANs are a class of neural networks that autonomously learn patterns in the input data to generate new examples resembling the original dataset.

GAN's architecture consists of two neural networks:

Generator: creates synthetic data from random noise to produce data so realistic that the discriminator cannot distinguish it from real data.

Discriminator: acts as a critic, evaluating whether the data it receives is real or fake.

They use adversarial training to produce artificial data that is identical to actual data.

The two networks engage in a continuous manner: the Generator improves its ability to create realistic data, while the Discriminator becomes better at detecting fakes. Over time, this adversarial process leads to the generation of highly realistic and high-quality data.
